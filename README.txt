Developed a RESTful Web API for managing a bookstore's operations, including book inventory, customer information, and order processing. The API allows CRUD operations and provides endpoints for:
•	Managing books (add, update, delete, and retrieve details).
•	Customer management (registration, updates, and retrieval).
•	Order management (place orders, update order status, and view order history)
